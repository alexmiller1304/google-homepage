This is my first introductory html project for TheOdinProject.com!  The idea is to create a non-functional clone of the Google landing page.  Here goes nothing!

Update:

Upon completion this was pretty fun!  Learned to use developer tools and Google to be able to put it together really fast with very little trial and error necessary.  Pretty fun stuff!  Nice way to flex what html/css skills I already had.
